Project Name:

Alphabetical Name Sorter using Merge Sort (C++)

Description:

This C++ program allows users to enter a list of names and sorts them alphabetically (A-Z) using the Merge Sort algorithm. It demonstrates practical application of Data Structures & Algorithms, along with dynamic memory allocation, string handling, and input validation.

Key Features:

Sorts a dynamic list of 20â€“50 names.

Uses Merge Sort, a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm, to ensure O(n log n) time complexity.

Handles C-style strings with strcmp for accurate comparison.

Includes input validation to prevent invalid entries.

Memory is properly managed with dynamic allocation (new) and cleanup (delete[]).

Allows the user to sort multiple lists in one execution.

Learning Outcomes:

Understanding and implementing Merge Sort on strings.

Working with dynamic arrays and pointers in C++.

Practicing memory management and avoiding leaks.

Strengthening skills for teaching or explaining DSA concepts.
